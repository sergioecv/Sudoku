# Sudoku
Sudoku Graphic User Interface in Python built with pygame, uses a backtracking algorithm to check every possible solution at any point.

## How to play
The board is set with a few numbers to start.
To complete the sudoku following the rules you select a cell and input from the keyboard a number, 
if enter is not pressed the number will stay as a draft, 
until enter is pressed the algorithm checks if the number is possible in that cell and if there's a possible solution with that number.
